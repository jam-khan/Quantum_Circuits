# Quantum Circuits
This repository contains the code for Quantum Leaf platform by Baidu for the research project in COMP3316 at University of Hong Kong.


## How to reproduce the results?


Every circuit in the Assignment 4 document has a number associated with it. E.g. First Circuit in the Assignment has (1), and hence, the name of the file of first circuit is Circuit_1.txt.

In order to reproduce the circuit, please follow the following steps:

1. Copy the code from the circuit file in this repo.
2. Go to [Quantum Leaf Baidu platform](https://quantum-hub.baidu.com/qasm)
3. Paste the code in code editor on the left hand side panel. Once code is pasted, circuit will be displayed on the right drag and drop QComposer.
4. Run the code on one of the simulators.
